    <h1>Ansearch privacy policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Last updated: 23 August 2025</p>
    <p>
      In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is
      handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We never sell your
      data.
    </p>
    <h2>What we collect and why</h2>
    <h3>Identity & access</h3>
    <p>
      When you sign up for Ansearch, we automatically collect identifiable
      information such as your email address and organisation name. This is so
      we can personalize your new account, send you product updates and other
      essential information. We may also send you optional surveys from time to
      time to help us understand how you use our products to improve them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will never sell your personal information to third parties, and we
      wonâ€™t use your name or company in marketing statements without your
      permission either.
    </p>
    <h3>Product and website interactions</h3>
    <p>
      We store the content that you let us access, upload or maintain in
      Ansearch. This is so you can use our product as intended. We keep this
      content as long as your account is active, and it is deleted according to
      <NuxtLink to="./terms">our terms of use</NuxtLink>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also collect personal information about your activity on our websites
      for analytics and statistical purposes. This personal information
      includes, for example, your browser and operating system, your IP address,
      which pages you visit and how long you stayed on them, if an error
      occurred, which website referred you to us. If you are signed in, this
      data will be tied to your user account until your account is no longer
      active.
    </p>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      We use persistent first-party cookies to store preferences, make it easier
      to use our application and perform tests or collect analytics.
    </p>
    <p>We do not track your activity on any other website.</p>
    <p>
      A cookie is a piece of text stored on your computer. It may help remember
      login information and site preferences. It might also collect personal
      information. You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block
      individual cookies in your browser settings, although our app will not
      work and other aspects or our service may not function properly if you
      turn cookies off.

      services as instructed by us.

    <h2>Restriction on use</h2>
    <p>When you use any of our software, you agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the software to break any laws or regulations.</li>
      <li>Gather or use information from accounts that aren’t yours.</li>
      <li>
        Attempt to deceive us or other users by making false reports or
        pretending to be someone else.
      </li>
      <li>Bypass or interfere with the security features of the software.</li>
      <li>
        Overload or disrupt any configuration or operations of the software.
      </li>
      <li>
        Send or try to send viruses or any malware, or add tracking tools like
        web bugs and cookies to the software.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must be a human. Accounts registered or accessed by “bots” or other
        automated methods are not permitted.
      </li>
      <li>Speak ill or damage, in our view, us or the software.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to the above, we reserve the right to suspend or cancel any
      account, at any time, without notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can report violations by contacting us with the details about the
      account and the issue, including URLs or screenshots. We keep your
      identity confidential.
    </p>
    <h2>Payments and change of prices</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        We offer trials on a case by case basis. In those cases, we explain to
        you the length and conditions of the trial. After the trial period, you
        will need to pay to keep using the service. If you do not pay, we will
        freeze your accounts until you make payment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our services are paid upfront at the agreed frequency and via the agreed
        manner automatically through the software or in writing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our services are exclusive of all taxes, levies, duties or similar (“the
        taxes”). Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the
        taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sometimes we change the pricing structure of our software. When we do,
        we tend to exempt existing customers. However if we change the price for
        existing customers, we will give you at least 30 days notice and notify
        you via the email address of the account holder.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cancellation, refunds and credits</h2>
    <p>
      We want satisfied customers, not hostages. We will make it as easy as
      possible for you to cancel your account.
    </p>
    <p>If you are unhappy with any of our services, please contact us!</p>
    <p>
      Our legal responsibility is to account owners, which means we cannot
      cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If your account owner has
      changed, or if you no longer know who that person is, please contact us.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cancel before the end of your current paid up period, your
      cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged
      again. We do not prorate unused services.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you cancel your subscription you can continue using the software
      until the paid period expires. Once your paid period expires your account
      will be automatically frozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer refunds and credits on a case by case basis, depending on your
      usage. Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you just got charged for your next period of service but you meant to
        cancel, we are happy to refund the extra charge.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you forgot to cancel a couple months ago and haven’t used our
        services since, we will figure out a partial refund.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you tried our software for a couple months and you are not happy with
        it, you can have your money back.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days
        in a month) or you emailed customer service and it took more than 3 days
        to get back to you, we will give you a partial credit to your account.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Frozen accounts</h2>
    <p>
      Your account will be frozen when a payment is missed or you cancelled your
      subscription and the paid period has expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frozen accounts will have limited access to our software. Once your
      account is frozen your data will be deleted after 180 days unless you
      re-subscribe.
    </p>
    <h2>Uptime and limited accounts</h2>
    <p>
      Your use of the software is at your sole risk. We provide our services on
      an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer service-level
      agreement, but we do take uptime of our application seriously. We will
      provide soon a link to track our historical uptime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the price of an artificial intelligence model we may have to limit
      your account. When this happens you will keep full functionality of our
      software, however we will change the default model to another model that
      is more cost efficient. Our software will notify you when you are limited
      and the limitation will be removed in the next calendar month.
    </p>

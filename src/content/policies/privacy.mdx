# Privacy

Last updated: 23 August 2025

In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We never sell your data.

## What we collect and why

### Identity and access

When you sign up for Ansearch, we automatically collect identifiable information such as your email address and organisation name. This is so we can personalize your new account, send you product updates and other essential information. We may also send you optional surveys from time to time to help us understand how you use our products to improve them.

We will never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

### Product and website interactions

We store the content that you let us access, upload or maintain in Ansearch. This is so you can use our product as intended. We keep this content as long as your account is active, and it is deleted according to [our terms of use](https://ansearch.net/policies/terms).

We also collect personal information about your activity on our websites for analytics and statistical purposes. This personal information includes, for example, your browser and operating system, your IP address, which pages you visit and how long you stayed on them, if an error occurred, which website referred you to us. If you are signed in, this data will be tied to your user account until your account is no longer active.

### Cookies

We use persistent first-party cookies to store preferences, make it easier to use our application and perform tests or collect analytics.

We do not track your activity on any other website.

A cookie is a piece of text stored on your computer. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect personal information. You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings, although our app will not work and other aspects or our service may not function properly if you turn cookies off.

### Legitimate interests

We use all the personal information collected:

- To ensure you have the best experience possible and improve our services.
- To tailor our communication to you.
- For our own internal business purposes and research.
- To enforce compliance with our terms of service and other policies.

### Sharing personal information

We may share the personal information collected with the third parties listed below for the purpose described in this privacy policy, or otherwise with your consent.

We only share your personal information with our employees, contractors and affiliated organisations that need it to process on our behalf or to provide the service, and that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

#### Service providers & partners

We engage with a number of service providers or partners to manage or support certain aspects of our business on our behalf. Those partners and providers are listed in [our list of sub-processors](https://ansearch.net/policies/subprocessors).

Our service providers and partners are required by contract to safeguard any personal information they receive from us and are prohibited from using the personal information for any purpose other than to perform the services as instructed by us.

#### Affiliates

Ansearch is a global business, headquartered in Montpellier in France. Your personal information collected by us in this policy is used and shared by Ansearch SAS to our affiliate company Ansearch Ltd based in Scotland for the purpose of delivering our service, managing your account, hosting, IT, security, support, billing, marketing, and communications.

#### Legal requirements

We may disclose your personal information to government authorities or other third parties if required to do so by law.

## International transfer of personal information

We are taking all the reasonable steps to ensure your personal information stays in Europe.  
To date only two of our sub-processors do not have an explicit European hosting: Google Workspace that we use for operations, and Stripe that we use for payment processing. In both cases the personal information that will be stored is explicitly given from you to us.

Where your personal information is transferred outside of Europe and where this is to a country which is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission or considered adequate as determined by applicable data protection laws, we will take steps to ensure your personal information is adequately protected.

## Communications with Ansearch

When you interact with our team in any way, for example for feedback, support, we reserve the right to publish or use this request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other customers. We will never publish personal information or confidential information in connection with our interaction and we will anonymise all such information beforehand.

## Payments and change of prices

1. We offer trials on a case by case basis. In those cases, we explain to you the length and conditions of the trial. After the trial period, you will need to pay to keep using the service. If you do not pay, we will freeze your accounts until you make payment.
2. Our services are paid upfront at the agreed frequency and via the agreed manner automatically through the software or in writing.
3. Our services are exclusive of all taxes, levies, duties or similar (“the taxes”). Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities
4. Sometimes we change the pricing structure of our software. When we do, we tend to exempt existing customers. However if we change the price for existing customers, we will give you at least 30 days notice and notify you via the email address of the account holder.

## Cancellation, refunds and credits

We want satisfied customers, not hostages. We will make it as easy as possible for you to cancel your account.

If you are unhappy with any of our services, please contact us\!

Our legal responsibility is to account owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If your account owner has changed, or if you no longer know who that person is, please contact us.

If you cancel before the end of your current paid up period, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. We do not prorate unused services.

When you cancel your subscription you can continue using the software until the paid period expires. Once your paid period expires your account will be automatically frozen.

We offer refunds and credits on a case by case basis, depending on your usage.  
Here are some examples:

- If you just got charged for your next period of service but you meant to cancel, we are happy to refund the extra charge.
- If you forgot to cancel a couple months ago and haven’t used our services since, we will figure out a partial refund.
- If you tried our software for a couple months and you are not happy with it, you can have your money back, except when you benefited from a free trial.
- If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) or you emailed customer service and it took more than 3 days to get back to you, we will give you a partial credit to your account.

## Frozen accounts

Your account will be frozen when a payment is missed or you cancelled your subscription and the paid period has expired.

Frozen accounts will have limited access to our software. Once your account is frozen your data will be deleted after 180 days unless you re-subscribe.

## Uptime and limited accounts

Your use of the software is at your sole risk. We provide our services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer service-level agreement, but we do take uptime of our application seriously. Visit to see the status of our Services.

Due to the price of an artificial intelligence model we may have to limit your account. When this happens you will keep full functionality of our software, however we will change the default model to another model that is more cost efficient. Our software will notify you when you are limited and the limitation will be removed in the next calendar month.

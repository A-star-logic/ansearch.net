# Ansearch Sub-processors

**Last updated:** January 1, 2024

## About Our Sub-processors

We engage with a number of third party processors to assist in delivering our services. These subprocessors are service providers who may have access to or process service data (which may contain personal data) on behalf of Ansearch and our customers.

This page provides transparency regarding the identity, location, and role of each subprocessor Ansearch engages. We maintain strict data protection standards and require all subprocessors to meet our security and privacy requirements.

We conduct thorough due diligence when evaluating new subprocessors. We ensure they provide adequate protection for the data they process on our behalf.

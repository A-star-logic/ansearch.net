      Your data is important and sensitive, that's why we go the extra mile:

      <h3>No passwords</h3>
      <p>
        We do not use a single password in our application.
        <br />
        <br />
        Make sure your email, Google or Microsoft accounts are protected with 2 factor
        authentication and you are good to go (and please ensure the 2FA is not using
        SMS, those are NOT secure).

      <h3>Pick the data you want to share with us</h3>
      <p>
        All of our services are relying on the industry standard OAuth, with the
        least permissions possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        Oauth allows you pick exactly what will be shared with us, and that you will
        never see the data of someone else, even from your own organisation.

      <h3>Data only you can access, dedicated nodes & self hosting</h3>
      <p>
        We have enabled row level security, this means that only you can see
        your data (on top of OAuth)
        <br />
        <br />
        Still too shy? We also propose dedicated nodes, or even self hosting if you
        require so.

      <h3>No duplication</h3>
      <p>
        We are using ground breaking technology that allows our solution to work
        without ever storing your company data. When you use Ansearch, all
        information processing is performed live, and all the documents or data
        we use are discarded after.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em
          >A more concrete example: when you search, we find emails, contacts
          and documents; we answer you based on their content and keep a link to
          display. Once our AI is finished, all the emails, contact and
          documents are discarded, and we only keep the answer.</em

          via our database service providers, this means when your data is not
          actively in use, it will be encrypted using AES-256 GCM, which is a
          strong algorithm that can even protect against quantum computers.

          This mean an additional layer of encryption on your data. This means
          this information can be unlocked exclusively by you, and even when
          being used by our servers, it is encrypted. We are using AES-256 GCM.

        <h3>Trusted providers</h3>
        <p>
          We use exclusively AI providers we trust, and we ensure suppliers also
          have strict data protection. For example we use models hosted on AWS
          or Azure instead of using Claude or OpenAI directly. Additionally, for
          all of our third party processors, we rigorously inspect their terms
          and verify they are all certified with SOC2 or ISO 27001. <a

        <h3>Cyber essentials + / ISO 27001 / Self hosting</h3>
        <p>
          We are a bootstrapped business, certifications are too expensive for
          us today, however we were certified in the past with another business,
          and Ansearch is compliant. (we know our stuff pretty well too,

            >you can check out this blog from our CEO</a

          offer self-hosting option.

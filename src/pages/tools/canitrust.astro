        Is the price listed without training on your data?
        <ul>
          <li>
            5: The pricing page shows the real price of the product / There is
            no prices (enterprise products).
          </li>
          <li>
            0: The pricing page does not show the real price, but a pricing
            where your data is being used for training.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <em>Why? This is basic transparency practices.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Training on your data:
        <ul>
          <li>1: Train on your data by default, cannot be disabled</li>
          <li>
            2: Do train on your data by default (Opt OUT required before use)
          </li>
          <li>
            3: Do not train on your data by default (Opt IN to let the service
            train on your data)
          </li>
          <li>4: Never train on your data</li>
        </ul>
        <em>
          Why? Training on your data is not necessary for the service to work,
          there are other, ethical, ways to obtain training data than forcing
          collection of user data.
        </em>
      </li>
      <li>
        EU hosting capabilities:
        <ul>
          <li>5: The service can be hosted in the EU</li>
          <li>
            4: The service can be hosted in the EU subject to specific
            limitations
          </li>
          <li>3: An extra cost is required to host the service in the EU</li>
          <li>
            2: An enterprise contract is required to host the service in the EU
          </li>
          <li>
            1: The service cannot be hosted in the EU / Does not guarantee data
            residency
          </li>
        </ul>
        <em>
          Why? EU has much better data protection laws than other places in the
          world, plus some businesses are required to host their data in the EU.
        </em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Retention policy (aside from HIPAA compliance):
        <ul>
          <li>5: Zero retention</li>
          <li>4: Can be automated for immediate deletion</li>
          <li>3: Automatically deleted after 30 days or less</li>
          <li>2: Automatically deleted after 90 days or less</li>
          <li>
            1: Require manual deletion (cannot be automated) OR Require an
            additional fee (business) contract
          </li>
          <li>
            0: Require invoking GDPR (or equivalent) for deletion OR Require an
            enterprise contract
          </li>
        </ul>
        <em>
          Why? Retention policies are important to ensure data is not kept
          longer than necessary. For apps, anything above 2 or more is great but
          not required. But it is very important for app developpers to ensure
          at minimum 2.
